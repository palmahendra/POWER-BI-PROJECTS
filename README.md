# POWER-BI-PROJECTS 
Here I created a Dashboard for Mexico Toy sales where I used multiple visuals to show the KPIs. 
like sales vs. profit over time, sales and profit by store location, top 10 products by profit, and top 10 stores that performed well.
Also created a slicer that can help us to filter(Year filter, store Location, Product category).
I have Uploaded the PBI file and source data.
